# Introduction

Critical transistions.

Two flavors: S tipping vs B tipping

Dimensionality.  Absense of an explicit model often makes it difficult to intuit if and how a complex ecosystem can be intepreted in terms of this simple one-dimensional bifurcation process.  Lack of clarity about what defines the "state" and what defines the "parameters" leads to confusion.  These issues are easily glossed over...

Focus on a prominent example from lake ecosystems.
