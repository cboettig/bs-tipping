Title: Bifurcation or State Tipping in a Trophic Cascade Experiment
Description: A trophic cascade involves indirect interactions among 
             more than two trophic levels in a food web. For example,
             a top predator is added, its prey become more scarce 
             (a direct interaction), but then the prey's prey become
             more abundant (indirect interaction between the top predator
             and the prey's prey). In some systems, as the top predator
             is added, the changes in abundance at other trophic levels
             do not always occur gradually, instead happening very rapidly
             near a tipping point. An experiment demonstrating this phenomenon,
             and aimed at evaluating methods for predicting such abrupt
             events in ecosystems, was conducted in a lake where largemouth
             bass were added to the lake. This sytem can be modeled as
             interactions among adult and juvenile bass, and planktivorous
             (plankton-feeding) fish, and possibly other portions of the
             food web (zooplankton, phytoplankton). The aim of this
             package is to determine whether manipulating largemouth bass,
             a state variable in the aforementioned model, induces a
             bifurcation, or results in state tipping. I.e., are 
             bass effectively a parameter, or are they truly a 
             state variable? The answer to this question may hold
             implications for how such rapid transitions are predicted,
             and how the results of past experiments should be interpreted.
